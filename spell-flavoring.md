# Flavor is free

## Cantrips
- Mind Sliver
    - Time fractures as the target's past thoughts echo in their mind. Each thought compounds until there is a cacophy of unintelligble rambling.

## 1st Level
- Shield
    - Light refracts in unusual patterns all around Eltaor making it harder for the enemy to strike with precision.
    - Eltaor's eyes go white as he allows his future self to take over, temporarily increasing his ability to perceive and avoid incoming attacks.
- Tenser's Floating Disk
    - Just a giant mirror or projection of light
- Magic Missile
 - Mirrored shards split off, flying errantly before landing in their target(s)
- Mage Armor
    - A more subtle application of Shield - instead of wild refractions the light hardens into a field of energy.

## 2nd Level
- Mind Spike
    - The targets eyes become clouded as visions of doom flood their senses.
    - The flavor of the doom (could) be expanded on based on the circumstance
- Misty Step
    - Eltaor conjures a mirror, his destination reflected within it. As he steps through it shatters and he appears in the new location.
- Invisibility
    - Shimmering lights form around the target(s) in a way that allows light to bend around them, giving an illusion of complete transparency.

## 3rd Level
- Hypnotic Pattern
    - A mirror is projected above the target area before shattering. The shards float, and each one that catches their gaze reveals the future they desire most.
- Counterspell
    - The target receives a series of quick visions that disrupt their casting by either breaking line of sight, or causing them to fail a verbal/somatic component.
