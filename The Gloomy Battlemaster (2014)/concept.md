# Roger
Just Roger.

## Background
Roger is a wanted man - a wealthy noble in Calimshan has placed a bounty on his head after he sold them a large dog with fur puffed out to more closely resemble a direwolf. Roger tried to continue his work in the.. "livestock business" with moderate success for a while. Months passed, and Roger became too complacent after this encounter. A mercenary recognized him leaving, and ambushed his caravan a few miles from town. 

The mercenaries spared Roger, only because he's wanted alive, and the animals were more valuable. Roger cobbled together all of his remaining gold and made way to the Icewind Dale where he primarily hunts, otherwise keeping a low - low profile.

When we meet Roger, he will have been in The Dale for a few years - living out of inn in one of the larger of the ten towns.

### Extra fun
This is written with the intent that Roger's caravan was the original meeting place of Simon and Nedar - it gets attacked, Simon ends up north somehow and Nedar ends up doing their monk training before also ending up in the north.

It'd be neat if Roger found Simon's bow and some crushed, moldy Nimsy cookies - he may not realize who it belongs to, but Nedar certainly would.

### Personality
While Simon was kind of intended to be just a massive idiot with a big bow, Roger is a cowardly, selfish guy traumatized from his caravan experience. He lost everything - his animals, his line of work, and essentially his identity. If he wasn't stock broke he wouldn't even be taking work.

I think that meeting Nedar, learning of Simon, and realizing that some of the noble headhunters may be in the ten town would be enough for Roger to want to stick in a group and maybe even convince the party to seek/kill them once we're more well equipped.

## Mechanics
We're going Gloomstalker again, I think it was the best circumstance possible to bring in a similar character since well.. they have a direct tie to Simon and (less-so) Nedar.

V.Human with crossbow expert, at ranger 2 we get archery and that makes us a very reliable sustained damage dealer as we learned when finally putting the grell down.
The plan is to go gloomstalker 5 -> battlemaster 3 for manuevers and from there we'll see what happens to our heroes.

I rolled less crazy stats so I'm -1 accuracy/damage and -1 initiative compared to Simon :(
