# Tank / Front-line concepts

When thinking about tanking I think of three questions:
- How can I encourage enemies to attack me instead of my allies
- How can I punish enemies who ignore that encouragement
- How can I soak all of the damage directed at me?

## The Ancestral Echo Knight
This build would be echo knight 6 -> ancestral barb 3/4 -> echo knight X. I'll take a glaive and stand in the front-line with my echo. If my echo and I stand parallel 20-feet apart we create a massive ~50 foot wall of of opportunity attacks.

### Optimization / DPR stuff:
I usually don't write anything about this but I want to make sure I'm in line with the party. Using the popular DPR calc at lvl 6:
- Assuming an AC of 15, my echo is summoned pre-combat.
- I have a +7 to hit, or +2 with GWM
- Initial round:
    - 4 attacks (1d10+14 each + 1d4+14)
    - 1d10 glaive + 1d4 glaive butt.
    - GWM: 32 (52 with advantage)
    - Base: 26 (36 with advantage)

### Stats
- Race: Goliath (any race with a +2 +1 really works)
    - Going v.human would drop my AC by 1, but bring me online faster (start barbarian 1)
- Str: 18 Dex: 16(+2) Con: 17(+1) Int: 9 Wis 11 Cha: 10
- Defense fighting style + chainmail/spint start
    - Unarmored defense is actually my best bet without magical armors (18 ac + 1 from defense)
- Feats: PAM+GWM (sentinel is an option as well)

### Tanking
- How can I encourage enemies to attack me instead of my allies
    - PAM reach to discourage melee from trying to walk past/around me
    - Echo gives me a lot of flexibility to reach and impose disadvantage on ranged attackers (while also leaving the echo back to help defend the party)
    - At lvl 9 ancestral berserker will give me a direct way to impose disadvantage on the first enemy I hit each turn.
- How can I punish enemies who ignore that encouragement
    - GWM damage + 4 reckless attacks at lvl 8 (2 + PAM + Echo if in range)
- How can I soak all of the damage directed at me?
    - Chain mail will start me at 17 AC or 18 if I can have Splint armor.
    - Higher con means I'll have 64 HP
    - Stoneform + Second Wind
    - Rage at lvl 7 for mundane damage

### Flavor
- Woo tragic backstory how original
- I feel like this character would be from a continent that is just pure punishment. Brutal mountainous terrain with tribes of goliaths and monsterous races fighting for the most habitable lands.
- Another tribe uncovers some eldritch magic, which is basically like giving nukes to muscled toddlers. They wipe out many of the tribes, including ours. We escape, but are haunted by visions of our tribesmen.
- Now alone surviving in this harsh, desolate world we indulge these visions more and more. They speak to us, they help us survive even. They teach us to hunt better - they teach us to camouflage our shelters and even alert us to enemy presence.
- Eventually these visions become more.. tangible. So tangible that we can fight with them, just like we would many years ago.

### Magic item ideas ???
I'm already a decent fighter/combatant, so I'd love something to help me tank better or help the party in ways that are not just hitting things.
- Our saving throws are an unholy nightmare so maybe a memento or token of my ancestors that helps me with mental saves??
    - Almost like a contingency, maybe once per day it can snap me out of a charm/fear effect by forcing me into a rage.
- Continuing the theme of ancestral knowledge, maybe I can roll on a table and get a proficiency for the day - or until I dream again and speak with my tribe.
