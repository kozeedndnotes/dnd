# Simon Says
The goal of this is to flesh out Simon as a character, think about his motivations, habits, and gameplay.

## Appearance

### Physicality
- Simon is a Custom Lineage (awakened experiment).
    - He has long, spindly arms and wide - permanently dialated eyes. Both of these are the result of crude experimentation forced upon him.
    - He is quite tall and chunky with a broad wingspan to match, but has a knack for making himself small and un-noticed.
    - He has thick brown fur, and a few patches of white scarring around his face.
    - He also has two fang-like canines that protrude just slightly.

### Clothing
- Simon is Monke - he technically wouldn't need clothes if it wasn't so damn cold.
- He wears patchy leather armor and carries a longbow, though due to his size it looks more like a normal bow on his back.
- He's been in the ten town long enough to gather some ill-fitting winter outerwear and spiked snow shoes that he hates because they cramp his feet.

## Character Traits

### Personality
- Simon is monke, he's not particularly smart, but can be endearingly stupid. He is very dexterous and insightful, an odd side effect of his awakening.
- Simon isn't particularly good, nor evil. He's very much so a blank canvas ready to explore his newfound sentience and the freedom it entails.
    - Because of his history he does not like the idea of enslaving animals - or even people for that matter. He'll treat any pets or mounts we pick up with as much dignity as possible.
- Simon does not like Duergar and possibly even dwarves.
- Simon hates the cold.
    - He hates getting wet, it sticks in his fur and chills him to the bone.
    - Simon would maybe join the party if for no other reason than to murder whatever being is causing this accursed eternal winter.


## Backstory
Simon was a show animal north-bound as a part of a trade set to take place in or around the ten town. He wasn't particularly fond of his master, or his life circumstance, but things took a turn for the worse when a group of Duergar ambushed the caravan and took Simon - possibly along with other animals to torture and experiment on. 

The exact reasoning for this is unknown - many subjects died outright. A few, like Simon lived which enticed the Duergar to experiment further on them. These experiments awakend Simon beyond typical ape sentience, though this went mostly un-noticed by the Duergar. They became complacent in containing Simon, and so he was able to reach through the bars and snap one of his captor's necks using his long reach. A key on their belt became his freedom, and on the way out he stole anything he could carry, namely a massive longbow. 

Simon wandered into the frigid night, cold - hungry - and nearly dead until he eventually he stumbled into one of the ten town (unknown as of now). Now (possibly with the help of an NPC), he's acquired some warm clothing, and a consistent place to sleep by selling game to the local tavern. 

## Goals
Usually characters should have goals of varying lengths - this is a bit diffcult for Simon who is currently just trying to find a sense of stability.

### Short Term:
- Simon is trying to find stable ground now - he doesn't really have broader ideals on life, and is simply trying to survive.


### Long Term:
- Potentially revenge on the Duergar that experimented on him.
- Potentially ending the eternal winter, or escaping it.
