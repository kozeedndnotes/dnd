# Tank / Front-line concepts

When thinking about tanking I think of three questions:
- How can I encourage enemies to attack me instead of my allies
- How can I punish enemies who ignore that encouragement
- How can I soak all of the damage directed at me?

I Rolled: 9, 10, 14 (reduced to 11), 16, 17, 18 for stats


## The Ancestral Echo Knight
This build would be echo knight 6 -> ancestral barb 3/4 -> echo knight X. I'll take a glaive and stand in the front-line with my echo. If my echo and I stand parallel 20-feet apart we create a massive ~50 foot wall of of opportunity attacks.

### Optimization / DPR stuff:
I usually don't write anything about this but I want to make sure I'm in line with the party. Using the popular DPR calc at lvl 6:
- Assuming an AC of 15, my echo is summoned pre-combat.
- I have a +7 to hit, or +2 with GWM
- Initial round:
    - 4 attacks (1d10+14 each + 1d4+14)
    - 1d10 glaive + 1d4 glaive butt.
    - GWM: 32 (52 with advantage)
    - Base: 26 (36 with advantage)
    - At lvl 7 I get rage (+2 flat dmg per hit)
    - At lvl 8 we get reckless attack to secure advantage

### Stats
- Race: Goliath (any race with a +2 +1 really works)
    - Going v.human would drop my AC by 1, start barb 1 -> fighter 5 to get ancestral protection a level early.
- Str: 18 Dex: 16(+2) Con: 17(+1) Int: 9 Wis 11 Cha: 10
- Defense fighting style + chainmail/spint start
    - Unarmored defense is actually my best bet without magical armors (18 ac + 1 from defense)
- Feats: PAM+GWM (sentinel is an option as well)

### Tanking
- How can I encourage enemies to attack me instead of my allies
    - PAM reach to discourage melee from trying to walk past/around me
    - Echo gives me a lot of flexibility to reach and impose disadvantage on ranged attackers (while also leaving the echo back to help defend the party)
    - At lvl 9 ancestral berserker will give me a direct way to impose disadvantage on the first enemy I hit each turn.
- How can I punish enemies who ignore that encouragement
    - GWM damage + 4 reckless attacks at lvl 8 (2 + PAM + Echo if in range)
- How can I soak all of the damage directed at me?
    - Chain mail will start me at 17 AC or 18 if I can have Splint armor.
    - Higher con means I'll have 64 HP
    - Stoneform + Second Wind
    - Rage at lvl 7 for mundane damage

### Flavor
- Woo tragic backstory how original
- I feel like this character would be from a continent that is just pure punishment. Brutal mountainous terrain with tribes of goliaths and monsterous races fighting for the most habitable lands.
- Another tribe uncovers some eldritch magic, which is basically like giving nukes to muscled toddlers. They wipe out many of the tribes, including ours. We escape, but are haunted by visions of our tribesmen.
- Now alone surviving in this harsh, desolate world we indulge these visions more and more. They speak to us, they help us survive even. They teach us to hunt better - they teach us to camouflage our shelters and even alert us to enemy presence.
- Eventually these visions become more.. tangible. So tangible that we can fight with them, just like we would many years ago.

### Magic item ideas ???
I'm already a decent fighter/combatant, so I'd love something to help me tank better or help the party in ways that are not just hitting things.
- Our saving throws are an unholy nightmare so maybe a memento or token of my ancestors that helps me with mental saves??
    - Almost like a contingency, maybe once per day it can snap me out of a charm/fear effect by forcing me into a rage.
- Continuing the theme of ancestral knowledge, maybe I can roll on a table and get a proficiency for the day - or until I dream again and speak with my tribe.

## The Fiendish Giant
This build would be giant 6 -> fiend 14. Very similar theme/flavor to the previous build, but instead of being a goliath I'd be like.. half-giant or half-goliath. 
This build has less actual tanking capability but a higher health pool, immediate access to rage, and some neat tactics once we get fiend levels. Basically much higher risk for much higher reward.

### Mechanics Issue / Question:
- Your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing.
- The way I read the giant subclass, our weapon grows with us and becomes an oversized weapon, which adds a damage die, so for a halberd it'd be 2d10 and 2d4 for the PAM attack. The difference here is ~5 DPR on round 1 (-2d10) and ~10 on subsequent rounds (-2d10 and -1d4).

### Optimization / DPR stuff:
I usually don't write anything about this but I want to make sure I'm in line with the party. Using the popular DPR calc at lvl 6:
- Assuming an AC of 15 and they are not resistant to my chosen element:
- I have a +7 to hit, or +2 with GWM
- Initial round:
    - rage + 2 attacks
    - 2d10 Halberd + 1d6 elemental (twice)
    - Reckless GWM: 39 (max non-crit is 80 damage)
    - Reckless no GWM: 35 (max non-crit is 60 damage)
    - Base: 25 (maybe if I'm really desperate to end something)
- Subsequent rounds: 
    - 2d10 halberd + 1d6 elemental (twice) + 2d4+1d6 elemental (PAM)
    - Reckless GWM: 54 (+15) (max non-crit is 80 damage)
    - Reckless no GWM: 47 (+12) (max non-crit is 60 damage)
    - Base: 34 (+9) (maybe if I'm really desperate to end something)

### Stats
- Race: Custom Lineage
- Str: 18 Dex: 16 Con: 17 Int: 9 Wis 10 Cha: 11(+2 req for warlock)
    - Makes me wish I did not drop that 14 (how did I let you talk me into lowering my stats ??)
- No defense fighting style and +2 to cha feels rough, I only hit a 16 AC as-is.
- Feats: PAM+GWM

### Tanking
- How can I encourage enemies to attack me instead of my allies
    - PAM reach to discourage melee from trying to walk past/around me
        - I'm large while raging so I occupy 10 feet, and have a reach of 15 feet out (the way I understand this, I occupy 4 squares and my reach starts at the corner - meaning I hold a 2x2 square and my reach is 8x8 around me. If this isnt how it works, this is much less effective.)
    - I'm a reckless barb with low(er) AC
- How can I punish enemies who ignore that encouragement
    - GWM damage + 3 reckless attacks with an elemental dmg type.
    - I can throw my weapon without consequence to maintain rage.
- How can I soak all of the damage directed at me?
    - Higher hit die means I have 75 hp + rage for mundane damage.
    - Lower AC makes reckless a meaningful choice and I'm relying on our bard healer to yo-yo me up more often probably.
    - Fiend 1 gives me armor of agathys and I can restore 2 temp HP when an enemy dies to keep it full.
    - Fiend 2 gives me 1d4+4 temp Hp for the same purpose.
    - Fiend 3 I can take a pact and there are two trains of thought:
        - Pact of the blade -> improved pact weapon
            - Lock 5 gives me dmg+utility via smites
        - Pact of the talisman on an ally -> rebuke of the talisman lets me protect an important ally
        - At lock 5 I can return it to myself for saving throw help.

### Flavor
- Similar to the first character.
- I feel like this character would be from a continent that is just pure punishment. Brutal mountainous terrain with tribes of goliaths and monsterous races fighting for the most habitable lands.
- Another tribe uncovers some eldritch magic, which is basically like giving nukes to muscled toddlers. They wipe out many of the tribes, including ours. We escape, but are haunted by visions of our tribesmen.
- Now alone surviving in this harsh, desolate world we indulge these visions more and more. They speak to us, they help us survive even. They teach us to hunt better - they teach us to camouflage our shelters and even alert us to enemy presence.
- As we level, my character will indulge in these visions more, eventually gaining their warlock powers and making a deal with.. probably the same fiend that killed his tribe, or a fiend that is in competition and offers us vengance.
    - Knowing I'll likely never get it because we aren't returning to our home worlds, unless the fiend were to be traveling here for some reason.

### Magic item ideas ???
- Is this the part where I ask for a magic weapon?
- Something I thought would be neat would be (since my weapon already grows with me) - would be for it to maybe transform with me? Maybe when I rage I can choose between the halberd style and greataxe style, and each one grants me a fighting style (def/interpose for halberd or GWM for the greataxe)?
    - Interpose is great, but I feel a bit worried that I won't have anyone with me in melee often??
    - Def puts me at 17 AC (basically half plate baseline)
    - GWM is a 3 damage per round increase on average
- Still also open to something that would help out saving throws, protect me from mental effects, or give me some out-of-combat versatility - the latter of which feels less important since I do get some spellcasting.
