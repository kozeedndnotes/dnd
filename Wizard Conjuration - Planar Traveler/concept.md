# A guide to A'hen the Cyclopian Wizard.


The goal of this is to get an idea of who A'hen is, what his motivations are, and how he will navigate the Icewind Dale.


There isn't a ton of supplementary details about the Cyclopians that I can find, so some of this is made up / pending approval to be canon.

## Appearance

### Physicality
- A'hen is a Cyclopian. He has grey toad-like skin that sits tight against his spindly frame.
  - Some Cyclopians have spikes, spines or other natural weapons, but A'hen does not.
  - He is quite tall - almost 6 feet, but is often hunched over so severely that he appears to be a small creature.
  - He is fully capable of stretching out and walking at his maximum height - he refrains from doing so partially to avoid unwanted attention from those that may view him as a monster.
- He has one large, white eye with a (typically thin cat-like) pupil that rests in the middle of his face.
  - His eye dialates massively when using his darkvision, it almost completely hides the white of his eye.
  - When entering the cyclotrance his already thin pupil turns into a razor-thin line that separates his eye from top to bottom.

- His face is almost skeletal, one large eye-socket that curls down into an upper mandible.
- He has long, thin hands each with three fingers and a thumb. His claws are very durable which is important for climbing.

### Clothing
- A'hen wears layer upon layer of dyed-purple wrappings - near his neck is a matching head cover that he uses for discretion when traveling, as well as to protect his face from the cold.
- He carries a simple backpack full of explorers supplies, as well as his ink and quill.
- A smaller satchel is strapped to his thigh - this satchel contains his spell book and arcane focus.
  - A'hen's spellbook is bound in the leather of an unknown creature. It was a gift from his mentor - and parental figure who is also named A'hen.
  
## Character traits

### Personality
- A'hen is obsessed with planar physics and the study of conjuration magic.
  - A'hen would absolutely do something dangerous or stupid in the pursuit of knowledge on these subjects as long as it isn't outright obvious it will injure/kill him.
- He is intelligent, and relatively compassionate, but lacks worldly experience.
  - He's actually kind of a coward and won't be one to initiate conflict unless the circumstances are severe.
  - Because he isn't particularly strong or durable, and is not a fighter, he'll slowly become fearful of enemies that are unaffected by his magic.
- Because Cyclopian's can partially subsist off of knowledge he's an all-round curious guy and will want to inspect interesting things the party stumbles on or neat items they may already carry.
  - He does not want to steal things and doesn't really care about posessions unless they directly contribute to his goals.

### Backstory
Cyclopians are capable of full-body Mitosis, and A'hen is the product of this. His mentor and "parent".. also named A'hen is one of several (~20) that all congregated in an abandoned wizard's tower. This tower was a massive library containing arcane knowledge from several schools, including an entire floor dedicated to conjuration, teleportation, and planar travel.

A'hen(sr) studied for years, but the amount of knowledge was overwhelming and eventually he underwent mitosis to create A'hen(jr) to act as his assistant. As A'hen(sr) began to study more and more advanced magic, he began to notice several books all referencing a long-lost form of planar magic that was only known to a sect of wizards that had long migrated north beyond the spine of the world.

A'hen(sr) takes off (with these books unfortunately for A'hen.jr) - telling A'hen(jr) that this is the perfect time for him to study on his own - to follow the path he'd already carved through the knowledge of conjuration magic, or to branch out and make his own.

We would find Ahen(jr) about 6 months after his mentor's disappearance, now following his tracks to the ten-towns.

### Goals

#### Short Term:
- Make friends. A'hen knows that he won't survive alone in the frigid north, and he'll likely need to work and grow stronger if he has any chance of locating his mentor.
- Establish a base of operations.
  - A'hen needs time to study and access to ink, paper, and other resources necessary to continue his research. Food and sleep are also helpful, though Cyclopians are known to avoid both in the name of discovery.
  
#### Mid Term:
- A'hen wants to continue studying while he is in the Icewind Dale. He'll continue to experiment and hopefully discover spells that interact with other planes (Blink?)
- A'hen also wants to ask around regarding his master. He's either hoping to pick up on some kind of lead, or as hard as it would be, find someone who knew A'hen(sr) and confirmed his death.

#### Long Term:
- Find A'hen(sr) or his body (specifically his spell book, and the other books referencing the knowledge he died searching for).
- Uncover the mystery of the knowledge noted in those books and obtain it himself.
