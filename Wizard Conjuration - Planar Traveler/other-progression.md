Aside from new and higher level spells there are a few ways that we can progress our character.

## Feats
- Keen Mind (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:keen-mind)
  - This is our level 4 feat almost without question. Its a half-feat so it rounds out our int to 18.
  - Hits on theme and practicality (The more I can remember, the more variety of objects I can conjure)
- Observant (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:observant)
  - Also a half feat and good theme, but the practical benefits aren't as nice.
  - I would take a +2 int ASI over this feature
- Alert (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:alert)
  - Our dex is bad, alert helps us get higher in priority so we can shut down a dangerous enemy, or set up to protect our allies.
  - Not a half-feat so probably won't get this before the campaign ends]
 
## Magic Items
- Arcane Grimoire
  - Even an uncommon grimoire gives +1 to our save DC. Helps us move those creatures along that would otherwise resist.
- Pearl of Power
  - Free 3rd level or lower spell slot
- Portable Hole
  - Wylie Coyote shennanigans
