# Spells
The goal here isn't necessarily to have an exaustive list of spells, its moreso to give insight on how I think about the spells I take, and plan for the future. Part of the fun of being a wizard is that I get those two guaranteed spells per level, but also have the chance to find scrolls and tomes that maybe have some neat applications that I don't consider at first thought.

Also a good place to talk about flavor or note questions I have for the DM about spell interactions.

## Cantrips
### Learned
- Hypnic Jerk (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:hypnic-jerk)
    - Wisdom saving throw (2d6 force dmg)
        - Is this strong? 2d6 seems higher than most cantrip dmg
    - Mostly like the flavor of making someone feel like they're falling
- Lightning Lure (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:lightning-lure)
    - Strength save to pull someone 10 feet
    - Can be used to rake someone over a bonfire or other hazard
    - Flavor thoughts - Instead of lightining energy it could be a conjured rope that drags them in then disappears? Snaps on a succeeded save.
- Create Bonfire (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:create-bonfire)
    - Works as a hazard to concentrate on at low levels
    - May have some survival applications
    - Conjured bonfire feels cozy theme-wise

### Future options (need approval)
- Misstep (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:misstep)
    - A small movement ability but one that feels easier to use on allies
    - Does consume their reaction but not always super important.
- Hobble (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:hobble)
    - Also feels thematically relevant
    - Bonus action so can (in theory) force movement, then hobble them to prevent them from escaping.

## 1st level

### Learned
- Catapult (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:catapult)
    - Good damage
    - Can interact with my conjured item or just random stuff on the ground
- Ice Knife (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ice-knife)
    - Aoe aspect
    - Conjuration spell (important for benign teleportation if we get to that level of play)
- Detect magic (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-magic)
    - Just a good wizard spell, feels normal for wizards to sense magic
    - Why didnt I use this on any of the puzzles?
- Fog Cloud (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:fog-cloud)
    - I feel uncertain about this spell
- Identify (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:identify)
    - Again just a good wizard spell that feels natural.
- Adjust Position (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:adjust-position)
    - Felt thematically relevant, but is just kinda bad in retrospect.
    - Would rather have Black Ribbon or even probably just a PHB spell.

### Future options (may need approval)
- Black ribbons (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:black-ribbons)
    - Its just web but seems more fun
    - Maybe themed as the ribbons coming out of my wrappings?


## 2nd level

## Learned
- Threshold Slip (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:threshold-slip)
    - Originally I thought this was bad, but I can bring an ally and its still a BA
    - Can I minor conjuration a door or window to use for this?
- Rope Trick (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:rope-trick)
    - Feels thematic but in retrospect I'd rather have taken vortex warp first and hoped to discover this later
- Misty Step (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step)
    - The quintessential teleporation spell at early levels
    - Slightly more free in the sense that I dont need any kind of "space" to slip through
    - More restrictive since I cant bring an ally
- Flaming Sphere (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:flaming-sphere)
    - Conjuration spell that does damage. I'd honestly rather replace this with Boiling oil.

### Future options (may need approval)
- Altheas Travel Tent (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:altheas-travel-tent)
    - Utility friendly option for those cold nights in the woods.
    - May not be considered viable for the setting.
- Boiling Oil (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:boiling-oil)
    - Yay hazards
- Vortex Warp (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:vortex-warp)
    - Just a really good teleportation spell

## 3rd level
This is unironically the hardest level to choose from as there are so many options for flavor, and also quintessential wizard spells like counterspell.

### Future options (may need approval)
- Counterspell (https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:counterspell)
    - The wizardiest wizard spell that isnt fireball
- Reciprocating Portal (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:reciprocating-portal)
    - Specifically offensive capable teleportation. Feels very good for the flavor and theme.
- Dimensional Shove (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:dimensional-shove)
    - Very versatile movement option
    - Technically worse than vortex warp unless you are pushing someone through a wall or other space
    - Puzzle breaker(?)
        - the target canâ€™t reappear inside a solid object or not on solid ground; instead, it reappears in the nearest safe, unoccupied space along the path of travel
        - Does this mean if I push someone through a 50 foot solid wall they'd travel to the other side?
- Gloomwrought barrier (http://kpogl.wikidot.com/spell:gloomwrought-barrier)
    - Not my first choice, but in theory it could be fun to trap someone in a sort of spooky "demi-plane".
