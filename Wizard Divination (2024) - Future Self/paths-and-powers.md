# Future Options
Elator's unique relationship with his future self may lead to opportunities to pursue power outside of normal means. The goal here is to think about the powers that would be useful to Eltaor and the thematic reasons for acquiring them.

## Feats
- Non-Combat feats
    - Observant
        - Stands out thematically with the Future Self catching those details that Eltaor may otherwise miss.
        - Would make Eltaor a passive sense powerhouse (20 investigation and 16 in perception or insight)
    - Skill Expert
        - Same as above
    Eldritch Adept
        - Fun flavor if the relationship becomes more antagonistic
        - Devil sight or Eyes of the Runekeeper
- Combat Feats
    - Alert
        - Being unable to be surprised and +5 to initiative feels on-brand for a diviner that can literally commune with their future self.
        - Kind of overpowered imo +5 to initiative is silly.
    - War caster
        - Eltaor's future self guides him through the pain, or even temporarily takes on the burden of maintaining the spell. 
        - Gives elator a bit of a buff to maintain concetration which they need for.. almost everything.

    - Metamagic Adept (subtle/twinned)
        - Eltaor's magic manifests unique properities as he works closer with his future self. By combining their effort they can subvert the typical restritions on certain spells.
        - Gives me some fun versatility, especially for something like a twinned haste or a subtle mind spike (Wow crazy that guy just got a huge headache and died)

## Items
- It could also be fun for my future self to know where an item is located based off of "their" experiences. Or even an item "they" buried/hid away for us.
    - Potentially good plot hook to get us moving somewhere.
    - Could be something buried at the Solstryce academy for example. Or back in Nicodranas, or another place that (present) Eltaor has not been.   
- Could also be represented through the mirror on my spell book (i.e finding components to upgrade it to a +1 grimoire and potentially further in the future.)

## The wild and wacky (i.e homebrew)

### Divine Transmutation
Eltaor's reliance on his future self slowly transmutes his spells into divination spells.
- Every long rest Eltaor can choose a spell from his book and designate it as a Divination spell regardless of its spell type.
    - Why(?) Expert Divination allows me to cascade divination spells, but that flow gets interrupted any time I cast a non-diviation spell. It basically just gives me more flexibility in my casting without directly giving me more spells.
    - Mind Spike is the only leveled divination spell that deals damage and its concentration, meaning I can't maintain any kind of buff or control spell while using it.

### Cosmic Scribe
Eltaor begins to work with his future self to better understand the arcane, allowing it to guide his hand as he scribes.
- Two key features
    - Eltaor scribes all wizard spells as though they are from his book (i.e 10 gp and 1 hour per level rather than 2 hours per level)
    - Eltaor can scribe spells into his book regardless of level (though he may not cast them without an appropriately leveled spell slot)

### Cartomancer (but homebrew)
Eltaor's visions continue to show him the destructive possibilities of his future. He begins to record these accounts, and sometimes gleans a spell that may be useful in the day to come.
- I'll create a table of wizard spells Eltaor does not know. Every long rest Eltaor rolls on that table and has the rolled spell prepared.
- The rolled spell can only be used once and functions like a spell scroll.
- Eltaor can't scribe that spell into his book, or into additional scrolls.
