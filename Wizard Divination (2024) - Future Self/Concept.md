# Eltaor Silverspear

## Basics
- High elf Divination Wizard
    - Something allows him to sleep/dream
    - Human ancestry? A more magical bond/reason?
- Sage
- Neutral Good(?)

## Flavor Thoughts
- Eltaor's divination ability comes primarily through a "future self" that may or may not actually be him.
- Eltaor sees this future self randomly in his waking moments and it may offer unsolicited knowledge or advice (Study bonus action).
- A mirror is embedded into the cover of his spell book, and he often uses it as a way of channeling that "future self" on his terms.

## Background Thoughts

### Family Stuff
- Eltaor is the older of two siblings, only his father remains
    - His father is of some level of importance to the local trade (Nicodranas looks like a port city, maybe he's a businessman?)
    - If so, maybe he's also involved in some shady deals like smuggling (something bad or dangerous) in/out of the city.
    - His (younger) brother is following right in their father's footsteps, much to Eltaor's chagrin.
- Eltaor was originally in line to inherit the business and was well learned, but left after learning of his father's misdeeds.

### Training
- Either way, Eltaor runs off and finds himself at some sort of "institutional" school of magic.
    - Eltaor is well liked, he's a decent wizard and is always willing to help others.
    - Eltaor begins having dreams of his future self during his meditation, eventually these dreams bleeding into his waking hours, and now he's fully capable of communing with.. "future him" 
        - Is it really him from the future? An alternative reality? Some kind of malevolent entity guiding him to a bigger agenda?

### Rival 1
- Eltaor hides these dreams, but narrows his study further on Divination magic. He becomes a recognized wizard amongst the professors which draws the ire of one of his peers who either knows, or suspects he is not completely forthcoming about the nature of his ability.
    - Maybe Eltaor complained about this - not realizing that he was well liked and it leads to the student being removed in some way?
    - This student could maybe be a noble "studying abroad" from a notable house in the Dwendalian Empire, who then uses his family money/influence to try and exact their revenge

### The Dreams
- Eltaor's meditation dreams have gradually shifted to become more and more haunted by visions of death and destruction. For himself, his family, and even just those in close proximity to him.
- These dreams only occur when he meditates - so he often opts for a typical sleep, which is less efficient and less restful.

### Rival 2
- Eltaor returns to Nicodranas - or at least specifically to his family after learning through his "future self" that there is a plot to have both his father and brother killed
- Eltaor's brother does not believe that this is the case and grows hostile. He may try to have Eltaor arrested or kiled even. (he thinks that Eltaor wants to return and reclaim his "inheritance")

## Goals
Short Term:
- Eltaor is looking for a job, or task, any excuse to remain in Nicodranas to keep an eye on his family.

Mid-Term:
- Eltaor seeks to understand who wants to kill his family and why.
- Eltaor hopes to find knowledge regarding his trance/dreams, failing that, a way to suppress them without losing access to his divination abilities.
