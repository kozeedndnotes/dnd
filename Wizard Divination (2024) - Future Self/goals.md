# Character Goals
The point of this is to flesh out some milestones that Eltaor can pursue to obtain power outside of the typical character progression.

## Rewards
see paths-and-powers for some ideas - Eltaor currently is working in synergy with his future self.

## Example

| Goal    | Complication | Reward |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Eltaor meets Feltaor  | Eltaor can't control his connection to Feltaor, only seemingly appearing when drunk, sleep deprived, or stressed.    | Eltaor learns new divination spells from Feltaor |

## Goal Proposals

| Goal    | Complication | Reward | Type |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Scribe chain lightning from Aerisi's book | Eltaor is not a powerful enough wizard + doesn't currently feel the need to learn destructive magic | ??? | passive, unknown |
| Make amends with Elwin OR Convince Eltin to turn away from a life of crime | Eltaor doesn't fully understand why Elwin still hates him after his time away | ??? | emotional, known |
| Perform every divination ritual | Eltaor doesn't know all of the divination rituals and isn't powerful enough to cast two of them | ??? | passive, unknown |
| Identify the red-haired elf he was warned about by Feltaor | Eltaor and Rhys both have the information to put these pieces together (I think??), but haven't communicated properly | ??? | known |
| Commune with Feltaor (intentionally - without assistance) | Eltaor still doesn't fully understand how to control or connect with Feltaor, his bond is stronger, but still untamed | ??? | known |
| Regain the ability to trance | Every time Eltaor trances, he is mired with visions of horrific futures that leave him worse for wear | ??? | known |
