# Homebrew Divination Spells
One of the primary issues with Divination Wizard is that they lack meaningful spell selection in combat. Mind Spike is the only combat divination spell in the game and it requires concentration, which makes us far less potent as a control wizard (basically relegates me to magic missile and cantrips).

## Thoughts
It would be fun to have spells that really play into the way divination wizards interact with spell slots and upcast mechanics. In many ways I think we could re-flavor existing spells with a more divination-centric tone - hopefully without damaging game balance.

## Combat Spells
I don't really have any (divination) way to reliably attack a targets' physical saves or AC - which leads to me being quite unhelpful against intelligent creatures. Having a diverse kit would make combat feel more interactive.


### Manifest Harm
Target a dex saving throw - the upcast is in line with Catapult.
- Level: 1
- Cast Time: 1 action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: S,M (a mirror or shard of glass)
- Duration: Instant
- Effect: Shimmering light forms into a weapon or object of the caster's choice before launching its self at a target. The target must make a dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 force damage.
- Upcast: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

### Diviner's Dart
Diviner's magic missile - same damage curve which is below avg, but guaranteed hit.
- Level: 1
- Cast Time: 1 action
- Range: 120 feet
- Components: S,M (a mirror or shard of glass)
- Duration: Instant
- Effect: Shimmering light forms into three small darts of force that chase their target with precision. Each dart deals 1d4 force damage and may target a different creature that you are able to see.
- Upcast: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd or higher, for each slot level above 1st you create an additional missile.


### Forewarning
Combat Utility + weaponizes reactions that often go un-used, allows players to choose what they do and if they consume the reaction.
- Level: 1
- Cast Time: 1 action
- Range: 90 feet
- Components: V,S
- Duration: Instant
- Effect: You peer into the fragmented futures of yourself, or those around you to carve out a moment of opportunity. Target one creature, they may choose to use their reaction to:
    - Make a single attack against a visible target
    - Move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks
    - Gain advantage on their next dexterity saving throw 
    - Gain AC equal to their dexterity modifier
- Upcast: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd or higher, for each slot level above 1st you may target an additional ally who may also use their reaction to benefit from the spell effect.

### Enhanced Study
Combat utility - mostly just gives guidance on what I can get out of the study action since it can be vague at times. Main concern is that it has room to slow down combat (no more than study usually does, but still).
- Level: 0 (cantrip)
- Cast Time: 1 bonus action
- Range: 60 feet
- Components: S
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- Effect: You study the target's present state and their future paths to learn more about them. On a successful Study check you learn all details the DM would typically provide. You then make a contested investigation or insight check against the target's deception. On further success you may learn one of the following:
    - The target's current alignment
    - One of the target's int/wis/cha saving throws
    - One resistance/immunity
    - The intended target of their next attack or spell action.
