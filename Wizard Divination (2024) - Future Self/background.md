# Eltaor Silverspear

## Family
- Eltaor was born to Eltin and Valana Silverspear (telemehte in elvish).
- A few years later Elwin Silverspear, his younger brother was born.
  - Tragically, Valana passes due to complications with the birth.
- Eltin was a silver worker who ran a small stall in the Skew.
  - After Valan's death he gets involved with the much more dangerous magical materials trade.

## Early Life
- Eltaor's early life is mostly un-notable, he lived in Nicodranas with his father and brother.
  - They moved from The Skew to a humble two-story shop in the Open Quay as boys.
  - This new shop, The Merchant of Venus begins to deal less and less in silver.
- Eltaor and Elwin both received a comprehensive education as tutors were sourced to teach, care for, and sometimes even house the boys while their father traveled for work.
  - The brothers grew competitive, and Eltaor always seemingly just a bit ahead left Elwin quitely jealous of his older brother.
- There was a point where Eltin took the boys under his own wing, specifically teaching them the merchant trade and bringing them to observe low-stakes negotiations.
  - Eltin wanted to instill in his sons the importance of being good, just, and kind to their patrons. He'd often make trades below margin when he could afford to do so and was well liked by most.
  - He also treated his employees similarly well.

- ## Departure
- As the boys grow into adulthood is very clear that Eltin favors Eltaor.
- At this point, the store no longer deals in silver. The patronage has become more.. unusual and unseemly, and the boys are no longer welcome in meetings.
- Both boys have a tense relationship with Eltin, suspecting he is involved with something dangerous.
  - Eltin is colder, more distant - and often disappears late at night.
  - His clothes and temperment change, he wears sea blues his voice low and harsh. His workers respect him, but no longer love him as they once did.
- After a particularly fateful encounter Eltin returns home battered and bruised, which is the breaking point for Eltaor.
  - Eltin finally explains the true nature of what the family business has become - a haven for stolen and illegal goods and those who would buy them.
- Eltaor, feeling betrayed and disappointed in his father, leaves Nicodranas.
  - He has no interest in being a criminal, pirate, or whatever he understands his father to now be.
  - Eltin begins doting on Elwin, teaching him the "new" ways of the business.
  - Elwin goes along with this mostly because he now is getting the attention and validation that he never got when Eltaor was around.
 
## Training
- Through a series of traveling merchants, Eltaor finds his way north to Zadash.
- Here, as a somewhat learned individual he finds a job teaching common reading and writing at the Apple Tree Tutor Village.
  - He befriends a human family who comes in to learn to read and write with their young son. 
- From time-to-time he visits the public archive and reads of many thing, including elvish history and their natural ties to magic.
  - Eltaor begins to study the (limited) tomes available on magic and quickly picks up on Mage hand.
- Eventually he meets (someone) who is connected and provides him an opportunity to meet (Important figure) in the Hall of Erudition where he is enrolled in study.
- He also would have traveled to the broader Solstyce Academy, but isn't familiar with the city outside.
- Eltaor is well liked, and a decent enough wizard, but begins having odd dreams during his meditation.
- These dreams bleed into his waking hours. They teach him greater magic and provide information to Eltaor - his prowess in the arcane rapidly outpaces his peers, which is noticed by teachers and students alike.
  - One particular student takes issue with Eltaor, becoming openly hostile and eventually attacks Eltaor leading to their expulsion.
  - This student is connected to (someone of power) in Zadash, and will likely be an important rival in the future.

## Dreams
- Eltaor's meditation dreams have gradually shifted to become more and more haunted by visions of death and destruction. For himself, his family, and even just those in close proximity to him.
- These dreams only occur when he meditates - so he often opts for a typical sleep, which is less efficient and less restful.
- Eventually these dreams show him a fate all too real to ignore - one of his father and brother laying slain on the floor of The Merchant of Venus.

## The prodigal son returns
- Eltaor begs for leave from the Academy, lying that he's received word that his father is deathly ill.
  - Eltaor is in debt to the Cerberus Assembly for the education he received.
- He returns to Nicodranas, first using a familiar to check in on his family before revealing himself to them.
- His brother is away on trade, but his father is home - their relationship is tense, but their time apart has softened them both. They would have reconciled only days before meeting the party.
