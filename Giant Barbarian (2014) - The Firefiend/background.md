# Hafit of Firebrand

## The Homeland
His homeland is a remote continent on the edges of the known world, known by few and explored by fewer. This world is full of perilous mountains, deep fissures, and icy tundra. Terrain with more mild climates are rare and heavily contested, often overtaken by more monsterous giant races such as Ettin and Fomorian.

Because of their secluded nature, the giants broke off into tribes and evolved a variety of biological and societal traits that represent their extreme environments.

## The Firebrands
The firebrands were an old tribe built into a natural hot spring at the base of a dormant volcano, which they quickly adapted to. Due to the extreme heat, their territory was relatively uncontested allowing them to nurture their affinity for collecting and molding simple metals. Eventually they mastered ironwork and, notably were one of the first tribes to successfully forge metal weapons and chain links.

## Hafit
Hafit is a halfling - his ancestry isn't fully known or understood. His father, Ar'kin was a great warrior in the tribe and lead many raiding parties to expand the Firebrands' influence, specifically targeting areas rich in minerals. After a long trip, Ar'kin returned as the sole survivor - carrying a young Hafit on his back.

### Notes
- Based on Volo's guide giants age at 1/4 the rate of humans so I've marked Hafit as half that (i.e ~40 is adulthood, and we'd meet him around 80 - roughly 40 in human years).
- This also assumes a few things about giant lore that may not be congruent with the world so obviously we may have to adjust a few things.

### Childhood (0-40)
Hafit's smaller stature, and.. unique characteristics made him a target to the other giantlings leading him to develop what could only be described as "little man syndrome". Hafit picked fights and often lost, which brought shame to Ar'kin.

As Hafit aged, he gained substantial stature - and Ar'kin began to mentor him in combat, specifically focusing on harnessing his "inner fire".

### Training (40-60)
After many years of practice Hafit has grown to be able to channel his inner fire, pushing him into a trance-like state. During this trance he's able to grow in size, not quite matching a full-blood giant, but great enough to stand on even footing in combat.

Hafit begins accompanying his father on raids to secure or reclaim their territory - notably a stone giant tribe, the BoulderFists have been tunneling nearby for centuries, their tunnels are beginning to encroach on the Firebrands' mines. 

Ar'kin, now old and no longer able to fight cedes the tribe's army to Hafit, who continues to lead successful counter-raids on the BoulderFists.

### Despair (65)
After 20+ years of being beaten back by Ar'kin and now Hafit, the BoulderFists retreat and tunnel further down into the core of the earth than they ever have before. In doing so they gain the attention of a demonic being that tempts them with power - power to destroy the Firebrands and any others that would stand in their way.

This entity grants the BoulderFists demonic magic - and provides them a plan of attack. A small force draws Hafit and his warriors down into the mines while the primary force attacks the Firebrand's village. The Boulderfists find a foothold above the village and rain both stone and eldritch magic upon the undefended inhabitants.

Blood and bodies litter the streets as this corrosive magic spreads through the village. Hafit and his army return, and in a fit of pure rage attempt to engage the Boulderfists despite their defended position on the mountainside. The magic kills most of them, and those that survive are decimated by volley after volley of stone.

### Predation (75)
Hafit somehow survives the Boulderfists' incursion, traumatized and unwell he survives purely off of instinct, unable to move on he never strays far from home. He often sees visions of his tribesmen. They help him survive, but push him into increasingly reckless action. Hafit develops a knack for isolating and slaughtering Boulderfists that wander too far from the pack.

(Now we just have to fill in the blanks related to his patron deity and the time between here and meeting the party.)
