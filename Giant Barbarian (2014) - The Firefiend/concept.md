## The Fire Fiend
This build will be a barb 6 -> fiend 14 barb/warlock multiclass focused on tanking by:
- Creating a huge opportunity attack range to punish melee combatants
- Having a long reach and (okay) mobility to interfere with ranged combatants
- Dealing great damage with little resource expense to be a constant threat 
- Eventually having ways to buffer my HP with temp hp which is also restored with low resource cost.

### Optimization / DPR stuff:
I usually don't write anything about this but I want to make sure I'm in line with the party. Using the popular DPR calc at lvl 6:
- Assuming an AC of 15 and they are not resistant to my chosen element.
- I have a +7 to hit reduced to +2 with GWM
- Base = Resourceless. No rage, GWM or Reckless.
- Initial round:
    - rage(+2 dmg) + 2 attacks
    - 1d10 Halberd + 1d6 elemental (twice)
    - Reckless GWM: 34 (max non-crit is 64 damage)
    - Reckless no GWM: 35 (max non-crit is 44 damage)
    - Base: 18 (max non-crit is 40 damage)
- Subsequent rounds: 
    - 1d10 halberd + 1d6 elemental (twice) + 1d4+1d6 elemental (PAM)
    - Reckless GWM: 49 (max non-crit is 90 damage)
    - Reckless no GWM: 40 (max non-crit is 60 damage)
    - Base: 25 (max non-crit is 54 damage)

### Stats
- Race: Variant Human
- Str: 18+1 Dex: 16 Con: 17+1 Int: 9 Wis 10 Cha: 14
- Feats: PAM+GWM -> str half feats, fighting initiate defense, sentinel are all great options.

### Tanking
- How can I encourage enemies to attack me instead of my allies
    - PAM reach to discourage melee from trying to walk past/around me
        - I'm large while raging so I occupy 10 feet, and have a reach of 15 feet out in any given direction.
    - I'm a reckless barb with low(er) AC
- How can I punish enemies who ignore that encouragement
    - GWM damage + 3 reckless attacks with an elemental dmg type.
    - I can throw my weapon without consequence to maintain rage.
- How can I soak all of the damage directed at me?
    - Higher hit die means I have 72 hp + rage for mundane damage.
    - Lower AC makes reckless a meaningful choice and I'm relying on our bard healer to yo-yo me up more often probably.
    - Fiend 1 gives me armor of agathys and when it runs out, I can restore 3 temp hp when enemies die.
    - Fiend 2 gives me 1d4+4 temp Hp for the same purpose.
    - Fiend 3 I can take a pact and there are two trains of thought:
        - Pact of the blade -> improved pact weapon
            - Lock 5 gives me dmg+utility via smites
        - Pact of the talisman on an ally -> rebuke of the talisman lets me protect an important ally
        - At lock 5 I can return it to myself for saving throw help.

### Flavor
- I feel like this character would be from a continent that is just pure punishment. Brutal mountainous terrain with tribes of goliaths and monsterous races fighting for the most habitable lands.
- Another tribe uncovers some eldritch magic, which is basically like giving nukes to muscled toddlers. They wipe out many of the tribes, including ours. We escape, but are haunted by visions of our tribesmen.
- Now alone surviving in this harsh, desolate world we indulge these visions more and more. They speak to us, they help us survive even. They teach us to hunt better - they teach us to camouflage our shelters and even alert us to enemy presence.
- As we level, my character will indulge in these visions more, eventually gaining their warlock powers and making a deal with.. probably the same fiend that killed his tribe, or a fiend that is in competition and offers us vengance.
    - Knowing I'll likely never get it because we aren't returning to our home worlds, unless the fiend were to be traveling here for some reason.

### Magic item ideas ???
This should probably align more with my patron deity and may be something totally different than the ideas listed here.

- Is this the part where I ask for a magic weapon?
    - Something I thought would be neat would be (since my weapon already grows with me) - would be for it to maybe transform with me? Maybe when I rage I can choose between the halberd style and greataxe style, and each one grants me a fighting style (def/interpose for halberd or GWM for the greataxe)?
        - Interpose is great, but I feel a bit worried that I won't have anyone with me in melee often??
        - Def puts me at 18 AC (basically plate baseline)
        - GWM is a 3 damage per round increase on average
    - Another thematic option for a weapon could be the Strike of the Giants feat
        - https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:strike-of-the-giants (1d10 fire damage to a weapon attack for fire giant)
        - Maybe this strike changes with my damage type, though I'm mostly intending to stick with fire for bg/flavor reasons.
- For a non-combat related item, maybe a token from my fire giant ancestry.
    - A forge hammer that gives me knowledge of metalwork (maybe some kind of bonus to crafting/repairing/investigating metal weapons and structures)
- The wild and wacky
    - A coin from my deity. Every time I level up I flip it (make a wis save) to decide if I take a level in warlock or barb.
        - Failure is me falling away from my deity and accepting the patron, success is me remaining a true barbarian.
        - Maybe the DC increases each time I take a barb level as the patron grows more persistent in collecting me.
    - Maybe grants me a different benefit based on the last flip made.
        - I'd just start with whatever the barb effect is to represent my straightforward path thus far.
    - Scary???? Barb 7,8 and 10 are okay but anything past that is very scary.
