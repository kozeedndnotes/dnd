# Bilxif Brasscut

## Who is Bill

### Into Adulthood

Bilxif, Bill for short. Bill was raised in the Seawea, his parents both dilligent pencil-pushing folks. They never accomplished anything remarkable, but they kept food on the table, and always had brand new hats for red hat day.

Life was good, and Bill was a smart boy, but as he aged, he began to think - a dangerous proposition for any youngling growing up under the Yeoen empire. Bill took little interest in simple book-keeping and instead began tinkering and building. 

His creations started small, unhelpful, and occasionally explosive. However, with each success he grew more and more interested with this marriage of magic and crafts - much to the chagrin of his family.

As Bill aged into adulthood all of his siblings grew into their roles as traders and merchants along the Seawea. Bill failed to retain a single job for more than a few weeks, his relationship with his family soured, and eventually he packed up and left.

### Drifting

After leaving the Seaway, Bill drifted for a long time. He'd occasionally land a gig - work for a while, and then be back on the road. After a few repetitions of that cycle, he'd move on to the next bowlay.

Along the path he met a few likeminded indiviuals. Arcane tinkerers, overly ambitious craftsmen, cooky wizards and more.. They'd always have ideas of starting some business, inventing some item, or developing a new spell - but all end the same. Failure, and an open road ahead. 

Recently Bill tried to start a joint venture with a human wizard - they were going to start selling magically inscribed tattoos. Anyone, even without magical talent could command the tattoo to change shape - and the premium model even had a spell wrought into the ink.

 Bill was the first test subject, and the spell stuck.. at a cost. Bill was laid out with a nasty infection for weeks, and when he finally healed his wizard "friend" had run off to go sell their invention elsewhere.


### Growing Roots
 And so once again Bill drifted, this time into Shang-Ha. Defeated, he finally gave up. His passion for tinkering soured just as everything else in his life, and he settled into working at the local smithy, sleeping in the back room and spending his days repairing and sharpening axes for the local lumberers.

 Over the years his primal urge to tinker and innovate healed, he bought a small shed and converted it into a workshop - and has been crafting and tinkering with the scrap metal he recovers from work.

 Shang-Ha is a volatile place, a bowlay on the outskirts of the Yeoen empire - a place of danger. Over the years Bill has acquired a few fun tools to help keep himself, and his (admittedly small) circle of friends safe. 

 - The scrap revolver:
    - A mess of twine, wood, rusted scrap metal and steel - its design is.. less than appealing to most, and looks like it could explode at any moment. It won't.
    - The barrel rotates and clicks with each fire, but its inscribed to provide magical ammunition.
- Bearings
    - A brown and tan clockwork dog - rusted and old, Tick is still as sturdy as ever. Sparks is a great help, and Bill is often seen riding him around town when he needs to haul anything larger than himself - which is quite common.
- Bolts
    - An equally rusted clockwork owl, however this construct is not of Bill's design - instead it was a gift from his parents, one that he begruglingly continues to look after for reasons that Bill isn't even sure of.
- The All-Purpose Tool
    - A magically enchanted tinker's tool that can transform its self into any other crafting tool.
    - Can also be modified to replicate just about any common magical effect (cantrips)
    - Received it in a trade for some custom smithing work.

### Current Day
After years away from the Seaway Bill received quite the surprise in the form of a letter from his parents. He hadn't seen them in years, and wasn't even confident they knew how to find him.

Unsurprisingly, they had not contacted him to reconnect frivilously. His brother Wexel was supposed to be visiting Shang-Ha and hasn't been home in a few weeks. 

Despite his reservations Bill packs his trusty tools, and winds up his rusty companions to go out and drag his little brother back to the Seaway.. or at least somewhere safer than Shang-Ha.

### Record Scratch
Now.. after all that, you're probably wondering how Bill got here - lying unconcious on the floor of an underwater cult / suicide circle. Great question, Bill doesn't currently know. We'll find out next time on dragon ball z.
